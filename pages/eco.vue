        One of our main visions is for Jivana Spices to operate in the most
        sustainable environment we can find. ​
        <div class="description mb-8">
          After many months of research, we have ensured that all our spice and
          product packaging is made from sustainable sources which are as green
          as possible.

        <div class="description mb-8">
          Our pouches are recycled, compostable, and have starch zips to enable
          an air-tight resealing, which not only protects your spices from
          light, moisture, and air, but also protects the environment from
          damaging single-use packaging. Our labels are made from recycled paper
          and vegetarian glue.

          Our products are shipped in recycled cardboard boxes, with recycled
          paper packing depending on your order.

          We do our utmost to ensure that any packaging we receive is always
          reused or recycled appropriately.
